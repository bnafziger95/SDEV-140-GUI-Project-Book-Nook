Book Nook: A GUI program to track books

This is a GUI program to log books and track progress. 
Books can be added as "Currently Reading", "Finished", or "Want to Read"
Books also are logged with a rating system.

This program is broken down into 3 windows, 
A manin window which can direct to an "Add Book Window" or the "View Library" window.

This is my first GUI project done with Python.
Enjoy!
